# Airbnb-Price-Predictor

All of the code can be found in the notebook and the report pdf has also been uploaded.

The report aims to investigate whether the features of a property listing can be used to predict its short-term
rental price, and if some neighbourhoods are more expensive than others. Furthermore, it will analyse
the differences in price trends during summer and winter, and whether or not the prices of the Airbnbâ€™s
have been affected by inflation or the cost of living crisis. We used machine learning to predict the price
with the given features of that respective property.
